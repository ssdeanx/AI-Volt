# Tasks

- This document outlines tasks that involve implementing hooks for cost and usage tracking in an agent system.
- The tasks focus on creating a universal `onEnd` hook that can be applied to all agent API calls.
- The goal is to track costs and usage effectively, especially for LLM (Large Language Model) interactions.

## Task 1: Universal onEnd Hook for Cost and Usage Tracking

- This task implements a universal `onEnd` hook that tracks cost and usage for all agent API calls.

```typescript
/**
 * Universal onEnd hook for cost and usage tracking.
 * Applies the "Non-thinking" rate to all agent API calls.
 */
onEnd: async ({ agent, output, error, context }: OnEndHookArgs) => {
  // ... any other onEnd logic you have ...

  // Check if there was any LLM usage to track
  if (context.llmUsage) {
    const { promptTokens, completionTokens, totalTokens } = context.llmUsage;
    
    // --- Official Pricing for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (Paid Tier, Non-Thinking) ---
    const inputCost = (promptTokens / 1_000_000) * 0.15;      // $0.15 per 1M input tokens
    const outputCost = (completionTokens / 1_000_000) * 0.60;   // $0.60 per 1M output tokens
    const totalCost = inputCost + outputCost;

    logger.info(`[${agent.name}] Token Usage & Cost`, {
      taskId: context.userContext.get("taskId") || context.userContext.get(CONTEXT_KEYS.SESSION_ID), // Works for workers and supervisor
      modelUsed: agent.model.modelId,
      promptTokens,
      completionTokens,
      totalTokens,
      estimatedCost: `$${totalCost.toFixed(8)}`
    });
  }

  // ... handle errors or final logging ...
},`
```
- This hook is designed to be applied universally across all agent API calls.

## Task 2: Fix tools Knowledge Base

- This task addresses an issue where the tools knowledge base is not being updated correctly.

## Task 3: Fix Prompt Template for Agents

- This task involves fixing the prompt template used for agents to ensure it works correctly with the new hooks and tracking mechanisms.
- Also makes sure that the prompt template is correctly applied & isn't being used in two different places.
- For example, the prompt template should not be applied in both the agent and the tool call, but also worker prompt templates should not be applied with same information as the agent prompt template.
- This ensures that the prompt template is used consistently and correctly across different components of the system.
