## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-03

### 🎉 Initial Release
First stable release of AI-Volt - A sophisticated multi-agent AI system built with VoltAgent framework.

### ✨ Features Added

#### Core Agent System
- **Supervisor Agent Architecture**: Implemented comprehensive supervisor/worker pattern
  - Main supervisor agent with delegation capabilities
  - 7 specialized worker agents (Calculator, DateTime, SystemInfo, FileOps, Git, Browser, Coding)
  - Memory management using LibSQLStorage
  - Delegation monitoring and coordination
  - Worker-specific memory isolation

#### Tool Integration
- **Enhanced Web Browser Tools**: Advanced web scraping and processing capabilities
  - Secure web processor with validation
  - Web scraping manager with rate limiting
  - Content validator for data integrity
  - Enhanced web browser toolkit with comprehensive features
- **Standard Web Browser Tools**: Basic web operations
  - DuckDuckGo search integration
  - Text extraction from web pages
  - Link extraction and analysis
  - Metadata extraction (title, description, og tags)
  - HTML table extraction
  - JSON-LD structured data extraction
- **Calculator Tools**: Mathematical operations
  - Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - Advanced operations (power, square root, factorial)
  - Input validation and error handling
- **DateTime Tools**: Comprehensive time operations
  - Current date/time retrieval
  - Date formatting in multiple formats
  - Time addition/subtraction calculations
  - Time difference calculations
  - Timezone conversions
- **System Information Tools**: Real-time monitoring
  - Memory usage tracking
  - CPU information and specifications
  - Network interface details
  - Process information and management
  - Environment settings analysis
- **Git Tools**: Version control operations
  - Repository status and information
  - Commit history and branch management
  - Enhanced Git operations
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **Coding Tools**: Development assistance
  - Code analysis and execution
  - File operations and management
- **Weather Tools**: Weather information and forecasting
- **Task Delegation**: Inter-agent communication system

#### Technical Infrastructure
- **Google AI Integration**: Primary AI provider using Gemini models through Vercel AI SDK
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with multiple levels and contexts
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict mode
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for all data structures and API inputs/outputs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling patterns throughout the application
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure environment variable management
- **Package Management**: pnpm as the standard package manager

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Google AI API Compatibility**: Fixed URL format constraints in Zod schemas
  - Removed `.url()` format constraints that caused "only 'enum' and 'date-time' are supported for STRING type" errors
  - Updated both standard and enhanced web browser tools
  - Ensured all URL parameters use `z.string()` instead of `z.string().url()`

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### Architecture
- **Multi-Agent System**: Supervisor coordinates specialized worker agents
- **Memory Management**: Individual memory storage for each agent using LibSQLStorage
- **Tool Registry**: Centralized tool management with category organization
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with proper abstraction layers

#### Dependencies
- **Core Framework**: VoltAgent for agent orchestration
- **AI Provider**: Google AI (Gemini) via Vercel AI SDK
- **Web Scraping**: Cheerio and Axios for web content processing
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking and schema validation
- **Utilities**: Various utility libraries for specific functionality

#### Development Standards
- **TSDoc Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all exported functions
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for all async operations
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Code Quality**: Consistent naming conventions and code organization
